# Public Logos Directory

Files in the `public/` folder are served at the root URL and are NOT processed by Vite.

## When to use `public/logos/` vs `assets/logos/`:

### Use `public/logos/` for:
- ✅ Favicon (favicon.ico)
- ✅ Logo referenced in HTML (index.html)
- ✅ Logo needed via direct URL path
- ✅ Files that shouldn't be processed/hashed by Vite

### Use `assets/logos/` for:
- ✅ Logo imported in React components
- ✅ Logo that needs Vite processing/optimization
- ✅ Logo with hashed filenames for cache busting

## Usage:

### In HTML (index.html):
```html
<link rel="icon" href="/logos/favicon.ico" />
```

### In React (direct path):
```tsx
<img src="/logos/logo.svg" alt="Logo" />
```

### In React (imported from assets):
```tsx
import logo from '../assets/logos/logo.svg';
<img src={logo} alt="Logo" />
```
